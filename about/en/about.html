                <p style="font-size: larger;">Welcome to Smartguide Holzkirchen – a bilingual website (English & German) that introduces you to the town of Holzkirchen in a modern, creative, and personal way!

<br><br>
We are students from the Staatliches Gymnasium Holzkirchen and have developed this website from scratch as part of our P-Seminar project. Our goal was to present Holzkirchen from a fresh perspective – informative, digital, user-friendly, and visually appealing!

</p><br><br>
<h3>🖥️ Our project:</h3>

We are already the second group of students to take on this project as part of the P-Seminar. Building on the impressive first version created a few years ago, we carefully analyzed its structure and content. Our aim was to take the website to the next level – improving it in terms of content, design, and of course, the technical aspects. We wanted to bring in fresh ideas and a modern look.
<br><br>
The website is bilingual (English & German) to offer both locals and international visitors easy and enjoyable access to useful information about Holzkirchen.
<br><br>
<h3>📈Our process:</h3>
Over several months, we worked intensively as a team – from initial planning to final implementation. To manage the tasks efficiently, we organized ourselves into three specialized groups:
<br><br>
Coding-Team <br>
Responsible for the technical implementation using GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, and other tools.<br><br>
Research-Team<br>
In charge of gathering relevant information from Holzkirchen – such as restaurants, shops, and cultural activities – and writing all content in both English and German.<br><br>
Design-Team<br>
Responsible for the layout, the visual design, icons, and the overall structure of the website.<br>
<br>
<h3>🛍️ Our content:</h3>

The website is divided into four main categories:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Food & Drinks – Local restaurants, cafés, and culinary recommendations</li>
    <li>Shopping – Stores, markets, and shopping opportunities</li>
    <li>Culture – Cultural places, events, and leisure activities</li>
    <li>Surprise Me! – A randomizer button that shows you something new each time you click</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>🔧 Technical Background:</h3>
The entire website was developed using GitHub Pages – a setup that allowed us to gain real experience in web development. From the first commit to the final launch, we planned, designed, and implemented everything ourselves.
